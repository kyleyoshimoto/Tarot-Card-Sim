# Tarot Card Reading Application

Welcome to the Tarot Card Reading Application! This JavaScript application simulates a tarot card reading, offering insights into various aspects of life such as love and relationships, money and career, health, and spirituality.

## Getting Started

To use this tarot card reading application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `tarotSim.js` file in your web browser.
3. You will be presented with a randomly selected tarot card and interpretations for different life aspects.

## Usage

- Running the script with Node.js will initiate a tarot card reading.

## How it Works

- The application uses JavaScript to randomly select one of 15 tarot cards from the Major Arcana.
- It also randomly selects two aspects of life to provide interpretations for.
- The interpretations are displayed on the web page, providing insights into the user's life based on the selected card and aspects.
